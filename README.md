# WhatIF
_WhatIF_ is an Interactive Fiction (IF) engine written for course OOP (HT2013) at Stockholm University DSV.

Using text-based input, the player navigates a set of rooms and interacts with objects.

The code was originally stored at CloudForge, but has been migrated to GitHub to preserve it.
